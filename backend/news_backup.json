        "content": "Many people reported feeling what they believe was a small earthquake on Saturday, January 31, 2026 - and the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed that it was a magnitude 3.2 quake.\n\nIt happened at 6:22 p.m., and was centered about 1.8 miles northwest of Malmstrom Air Force Base at a depth of six miles.\n\nWe began receiving reports at about 6:23 p.m. Among the messages we received:\n\n\n\nI felt a rumble and so did my neighbor. 2 blocks from Montana Credit Union\n\nPossible aftershock that just happened at 6:23 pm\n\nFriend also said they felt it in riverview\n\nMy parents said they felt it\n\nAfter shock??? 6:27pm??\n\nDid we have another aftershock just now?\n\nAnother earthquake just now. Not as strong as the previous one\n\nHeard boom about 7 minutes ago, another after shock?\n\nAt this point, there are no reports of any injuries or damage.\n\nWe will update you if we get more information.\n\nThis comes just two days after a magnitude 4.2 quake rattled the area, centered about 4.9 miles northeast of Great Falls.\n\nSeismologists said that small aftershocks are possible in the days after the initial quake, which is likely what happened on Saturday.\n\nOn Thursday, KRTV was interviewing Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter (for an unrelated story) when the earthquake hit - watch the video:\n\nResidents react as earthquake shakes Great Falls\n\nThe Treasure State is in one of the most seismically active regions in the United States. The intermountain seismic belt, which runs through the western third of the state, is where most of the earthquake activity occurs in Montana. The vast majority of the many quakes across the region are very small, rarely felt by people, and cause no damage. There is a team of experts at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory who keep track of them all; click here to visit the website.\n\nThere is also an Earthquake Studies Office on the campus of Montana Tech in Butte. It operates the Montana Regional Seismic Network, a network of 42 permanent seismic stations located throughout western Montana. The website notes: \"Although it has been over four decades since the last destructive earthquake in Montana, small earthquakes are common in the region, occurring at an average rate of 7-10 earthquakes per day.\"\n\nThe website features several interactive maps, including one that shows the 2,395 earthquakes recorded in Montana during 2018 and additional earthquakes in the surrounding region. All but 23 of those quakes registered as less than 3.0, which demonstrates how small and imperceptible the vast majority are.\n\nThere have been some notable earthquakes in Montana\u2019s history, including the 7.3 magnitude Hebgen Lake earthquake on August 17, 1959. The earthquake triggered more than 160 new geysers throughout Yellowstone National Park. There were also around 28 fatalities from a rockslide in Madison Canyon.\n\nAnd on July 6, 2017, one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Montana in decades shook the community of Lincoln northwest of Helena. It was centered 5.5 miles southeast of Lincoln at a depth of about 2.6 miles. People reported feeling the 5.8 magnitude quake across Montana and the northwest, with some reports coming from as far away as Vancouver and Lethbridge, Canada. It caused some minor damage, but no serious injuries.\n\nIn January 2026, a 4.2 quake shook several miles northeast of Great Falls; no injuries and no serious damage were reported - click here for details.\n\nThe quake happened at 12:41 p.m., and was centered about 4.9 miles northeast of Great Falls at a depth of about 13.6 miles.\n\nMTN News was interviewing Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter (for an unrelated story) when the earthquake hit - watch the video:\n\nResidents react as earthquake shakes Great Falls\n\nThe plains of central and eastern Montana are much less prone to quakes, but there have been a handful of significant ones reported.\n\nAccording to the USGS, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake struck northeastern Montana on May 15th, 1909.\n\nSeveral smaller quakes have been recorded in Roosevelt County, including an estimated 4.5 magnitude quake in the town of Froid that resulted in some damage to a grain bin back in 1943.\n\nAlthough it has been some time since the state has seen a destructive earthquake, small quakes occur several times every day.

        "content": "Earthquakes Update: Jan. 30 - 3.4 magnitude earthquake reported near San Ramon, CA\n\nCONTRA COSTA COUNTY, CA - Friday morning, a 3.4 magnitude quake was detected close to San Ramon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe tremor rattled the area at 10:33 a.m. It occurred at a depth of 6 miles with the epicenter located about 2 miles southeast of San Ramon.\n\nDid you feel it?\n\nYou can let the USGS know if you experienced the earthquake by filling out their Felt Report form. The agency has received 634 responses on its online form so far, from people reporting they experienced the quake. According to the USGS DYFI report, people in several cities, including Burlingame, Berkeley, Martinez and Oakland, reported experiencing weak shaking from the tremor.\n\nDid you capture the effect?\n\nIf you have photos showing the aftermath of the earthquake, we invite you to share them with us at sacbee.com/customer-service/submit-photo.\n\nPast week's quake\n\nLast week, a magnitude 3.0 quake was registered nearby, with the event occurring near Pittsburg five days ago.\n\nWhat to know about earthquakes\n\nMagnitude measures the energy released at the source of the earthquake, the U. S. Geological Survey says. It replaces the old Richter scale. Quakes between 2.5 and 5.4 magnitude are often felt but rarely cause much damage, according to Michigan Tech. Earthquakes below 2.5 magnitude are seldom felt by most people.\n\nEarthquakes' sudden, rapid shaking can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. They can happen anywhere, but are most common in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Puerto Rico and Washington, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt, and 100 of them cause damage.\n\nWhat to do during an earthquake\n\nIf an earthquake strikes, it's best to protect yourself right away. Here are tips from experts:\n\nIf you're in a car: Pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.\n\nIf you're in bed: Turn face-down and cover your head with a pillow.\n\nIf you're outdoors: Stay away from buildings. Don't go inside.\n\nIf you're inside: Stay and don't run outdoors. Stay away from doorways.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself during an earthquake is to drop, cover and hold on, officials say. \"Wherever you are, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy,\" officials say. \"If you're using a wheelchair or walker with a seat, make sure your wheels are locked and remain seated until the shaking stops.\" Be sure to cover your head and neck with your arms, and crawl under a sturdy table if possible. If no shelter is available, crawl to an interior wall away from windows. Once under a table, officials say you should hold on with one hand and be ready to move with it.\n\n\"There can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water lines, or downed power lines,\" officials say. \"Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake. Be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On if you feel an aftershock.\"\n\nSource: The U.S. Geological Survey\n\nUnited Robots California\n\nThis story was originally published January 30, 2026 at 10:38 AM.",

        "content": "Some scientists and Colorado residents are raising concern that the state\u2019s messaging and management of beetle-killed forests do not align with the published research on the interaction between dead trees and wildfires.\n\nMountain pine beetle impacts are receiving renewed attention after Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued an executive order in December to assemble a task force aimed at responding to a beetle outbreak affecting ponderosa forests on the Front Range.\n\n\u201cColorado has long been a leader in forest health and fire mitigation efforts, and this is no exception,\u201d Polis said in a news release announcing the executive order. \u201cAs the latest outbreak of pine beetles begins to take shape along the densely populated Front Range, we are taking an aggressive approach to boost tools and partnerships to protect our communities, forests, and key water sources, and equipping homeowners with the resources they need to protect their homes.\u201d\n\nAerial forest health surveys conducted last year by the U.S. Forest Service and Colorado State Forest Service reveal a \u201csignificant and expanding mountain pine beetle outbreak in Ponderosa pine forests up and down the Front Range,\u201d according to the news release. In addition to creating a task force focused on the beetle outbreak, Polis\u2019 Office said it will seek to extend funding for \u201ccritical wildfire mitigation\u201d and tax incentives for companies to remove beetle-killed trees for use in products.\n\nThe news release states that beetle-killed forests increase the wildfire risk to communities and claims that \u201cearly action is essential to reducing long-term fire risk\u201d because \u201cas mortality increases, standing dead timber can intensify fire behavior.\u201d The release quotes state and federal officials, as well as agency heads, some of whom repeat these claims.\n\nHowever, interviewed scientists and a review of published research on the topic , refutes the common premise that trees killed by mountain pine beetles are more susceptible to wildfires and increase wildfire severity. Some peer-reviewed research on the topic suggests that beetle-killed trees can be less flammable.\n\nThomas Veblen, a retired University of Colorado Boulder professor who has studied mountain pine beetle outbreaks and wildfires in Colorado, was among those who were frustrated by the claims made by the Governor\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cThe messaging that is aimed at alarming the public about increased fire risk due to beetle-caused tree mortality is not consistent with the published research,\u201d Veblen said. \u201cWhat has been left out of the press releases on this, or the one press release, is some summary of what was learned from the previous beetle emergency from the late 1990s through the early 2000s.\u201d\n\nThe Governor\u2019s Office forwarded emailed questions from Summit Daily News regarding the wildfire risks of beetle-killed forests to the Colorado State Forest Service and state Department of Natural Resources.\n\nAfter consulting with experts, state Department of Natural Resources communications director Chris Arend said, the \u201clikelihood of wildfire (annual burn probability or chance of a fire starting) doesn\u2019t change due to beetle activity. Arend added, \u201cit is worth acknowledging that research on the interactions between beetle-killed trees and wildfires is evolving.\u201d More research is needed, he said, noting that the issue is \u201cnuanced.\u201d\n\nThe news release from Polis\u2019 also notes that \u201cbeetle-killed trees can create hazards for firefighters, hikers, utility providers and local infrastructure,\u201d and notes that many of the areas most vulnerable to beetle kill are located near \u201cdensely populated communities within the Front Range foothills.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Governor\u2019s Office did not return a request for comment before publication regarding why the news release suggests that beetle-kill trees increase fire risk, when the science and the state\u2019s own experts don\u2019t show that.\n\nScientists say mountain pine beetles are natural, help biodiversity\n\nBark beetles are native species that have co-evolved with specific host species of trees in the West, according to the Colorado State Forest Service. Mountain pine beetles tend to attack ponderosa pines and lodgepole pines.\n\nVeblen began researching the interaction between bark beetles and wildfires in the late-1980s, developing a technique of \u201ctree ring reconstruction\u201d that shows prehistoric wildfires and beetle outbreaks going back to the 1600s. He said his studies showed that regional-scale bark beetle outbreaks and high-severity wildfires are not unprecedented in the mountain West and have occurred for centuries, especially during extreme drought conditions.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the tree-ring records of fires over the last several centuries, we have not seen a significant increase in either pine beetle outbreak or fire activity, compared to the 19th century or earlier,\u201d Veblen said.\n\nThat may be surprising since wildfires like those that occurred in 2020 in Colorado have been described as unprecedented, but the tree records show that \u201cvery large, high-severity fires\u201d are \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d Veblen said, especially in high-elevation forests. He pointed to an example when the entire western side of what is now Rocky Mountain National Park burned in 1851, encompassing nearly all of the current zone of lodgepole pine around the town of Grand Lake.\n\nWhat is different in the 21st century is that more people live in these mountain areas and the impacts of climate change are resulting in drought conditions becoming more common and occurring with more regularity across the West, Veblen said. He noted that drought conditions also weaken trees\u2019 defenses, making them more susceptible to beetles, and warmer winters may result in increased beetle survival.\n\n\u201cWe know warming temperatures are creating conditions that are more conducive for bark beetle outbreaks,\u201d Veblen said. \u201cSo it\u2019s likely that over the next several decades, we\u2019re going to see abundant beetle activity, but it\u2019s not completely unprecedented.\u201d\n\n\n\nDominick DellaSala, a senior conservation scientist at the California-based Conservation Biology Institute, has studied forest ecosystems across the Western U.S., including the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe lead author of a recent scientific paper entitled, \u201cRemoving dead trees will not save us from fast moving wildfires ,\u201d DellaSala said the common assumption that beetle-killed trees increase wildfire risk has not been proven.\n\n\u201cContrary to what most people think, dead trees lose their flammable properties very shortly after they go through their needle phase,\u201d DellaSala said. \u201cSo they have a red-phase and a gray-phase in terms of how the needles change colors. Once those needles drop out of the canopy, which is one to three years \u2026 they\u2019re no longer flammable. There\u2019s no live fuel in the canopy to cover a crown fire.\u201d\n\nArend, the state Department of Natural Resources communications director, noted that while \u201cannual burn probability is unaltered\u201d in beetle-killed forests, \u201cwhat does change is that surface fire can transition to crown fire under a wider range of environmental conditions and lower wind speeds.\u201d He also noted when red needles are in the canopy they can have a \u201clower foliar fuel moisture\u201d and \u201cmay facilitate a transition in fire type from surface to crowning under a wider range of fuel moisture conditions and lower wind speeds.\u201d\n\nForests with dead trees are not actually dead, DellaSala said, noting that ecologists recognize that these forests have \u201cexceptional biodiversity.\u201d He said policies aimed at removing dead trees, such as those killed by beetles, from the landscape may hurt, rather than help, ecosystems.\n\nWhile policy makers and forest managers often see removal of dead trees as an \u201ceasy solution\u201d that the public is generally in favor of, DellaSala said he believes that dead tree removal tends to be more focused on economics than reducing wildfire risk. He noted that companies that remove dead trees tend to want to remove trees before they start to decay and often want to remove the largest dead trees, which are the most profitable but also the most valuable to ecosystems.\n\n\u201cInstead of just saying, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got economic interests,\u2019 they cloak it in misinformation that these trees are going to all burn up and they\u2019re contributing to fast fires,\u201d DellaSala said. \u201cIn fact, we know that the science, much of which has been developed in the Rockies, says the opposite is the case.\u201d\n\nArend, the state Department of Natural Resource communications director, in response to questions about the state\u2019s beetle-kill tax incentives said, \u201cthere is positive feedback from industry partners and the number of manufacturers that apply for the exemption that they benefit from them.\u201d\n\nThe state Department of Natural Resources claimed that salvaging beetle-killed trees and converting them into forest products \u201ccan store carbon\u201d that would otherwise be released through decomposition or burning in a wildfire.\n\n\u201cMountain pine beetle outbreaks result in many dead trees, so there are both economic and ecological benefits to utilizing some of that beetle-killed wood than allowing it to decompose by turning them into forest products, and tax incentives encourage that,\u201d Ardened said. \u201c\u2026 Bark beetles don\u2019t necessarily drive wildfire risk, but the dead trees can significantly add to fuel loads, and programs like this provide an incentive to remove some of this fuel from the affected forest and reduce fire intensity.\u201d\n\nDellaSala and Veblen both questioned the efficacy of forest \u201cthinning\u201d and \u201cfuel reduction\u201d projects such as those that occur across Colorado. While these types of projects may reduce wildfire risk under some conditions, wildfires in Colorado tend to be driven by extreme fire weather \u2014 or a combination of dry conditions and high winds.\n\n\u201cThinning really isn\u2019t going to work under those conditions,\u201d DellaSala said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to actually have more impacts on forests, especially if you don\u2019t dispose of the slash, and you\u2019re not going to get all of it, because it\u2019s costly to get rid of that slash. Then you have impacts to the soil, impacts to wildlife habitat.\u201d\n\nVeblen said that removal of hazardous dead trees that could fall near trails, campgrounds or infrastructure, \u201cmakes sense,\u201d but that there is little evidence to support that projects focused on backcountry areas away from communities reduce wildfire risk.\n\nBoth DellaSala and Veblen noted that there is evidence showing that home hardening and creating defensible space, or buffer zones around residential properties, are the best ways to protect communities from wildfires. Both also noted that decommissioning or closing roads, which studies have shown increase the chances of wildfires starting due to human causes, could also reduce wildfire risk.\n\nThe state Department of Natural Resources also cited home hardening and defensible space as important strategies.\n\n\u201cHopefully people on (the Governor\u2019s) task force will be interested in \u2018Hey, this is where we can really have an impact, let\u2019s put our resources there,\u2019 rather than continuing to do what is sometimes referred to as paddling upstream, reducing fuels in the hope that that may prevent fires from spreading,\u201d Veblen said.\n\nCitizens continue to raise questions\n\nHoward Brown, a resident of the Silverthorne area, first started speaking out about forest management projects in around 2015, when a mountain pine beetle epidemic decimated Summit County\u2019s lodgepole pine stands.\n\nBrown, a former environmental policy analyst for the Congressional Research Service, said he became concerned about the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s proposal to clear-cut a 1,500-acre area near Breckenridge and Frisco in the name of wildfire prevention. He spearheaded a petition that gathered dozens of signatures of residents opposed to the project, but the petition was unsuccessful at stopping it.\n\nDespite widespread fears that beetle-kill would increase wildfire risk, Brown said that Summit County has not seen major wildfires in the more than a decade since that previous beetle outbreak. He noted that most wildfires in the county are human-caused and suggested that banning campfires, while unpopular, would prove more effective at reducing wildfire risk than forest management like \u201cthinning\u201d or \u201cfuel reduction\u201d projects.\n\n\u201cThe threat of fire (due to beetle-killed trees) is really a red herring,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s a false pretense being used to scare people and get away with destroying the forest for very dubious purposes.\u201d\n\nNederland resident Josh Schlossberg is the Colorado advocate for the Eco-Integrity Alliance , a grassroots advocacy organization that calls for limiting management in favor of \u201cecological balance\u201d on public lands.\n\nSchlossberg referred to the widespread concern that beetle-kill will increase wildfire risk as \u201cbeetlemania.\u201d He said he was surprised to see the Colorado government repeating the same talking points that were raised more than a decade ago, despite no evidence that the previous wave of beetle-kill increased wildfire risk.\n\n\u201cThe beetles come in and they\u2019re doing their job and they\u2019re being demonized,\u201d Schlossberg said. \u201cThey\u2019re native wildlife that have always been here that are creating that structure. Nature knows what it is doing. Nature has been here for hundreds of thousands to millions of years before the first humans set foot on this continent. We have to trust nature.\u201d\n\nBoth Schlossberg and Brown said that they\u2019re concerned that government leaders and the logging industry are taking advantage of the fear of wildfires to advance policies and management goals that don\u2019t actually reduce the wildfire risk for communities.\n\nSchlossberg encouraged Colorado residents to get involved at a local level to encourage policy makers to seriously consider whether forest management projects will result in reduced wildfire risk or not.\n\n\u201cTake your healthy skepticism and apply it to what is happening on our last best ecosystems on public lands,\u201d Schlossberg said. \u201cPeople moved to Colorado because of the ecosystems. It seems like so many Coloradans are just willing to look the other way or have not been made aware of this.\u201d",

A single winter system can produce vastly different conditions across a region\u2014such as a blizzard in one area and just rain in another\u2014making a single name potentially misleading to the public.\n\nThe names you may have seen were developed without collaboration or consultation with official global weather authorities like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the American Meteorological Society (AMS). Official agencies argue that naming winter storms is driven more by social media needs, such as creating hashtags, and marketing rather than sound meteorological science. The NWS has advised its forecast offices to avoid these names because they can create confusion, as the names are not used on official government warnings or safety bulletins.\n\nIn a statement to FOX Weather, the National Weather Service said, \"The NWS will name tropical systems, but does not do this unilaterally - these names are from a list established by an international committee of the U.N. World Meteorological Organization.\n\nSpokesperson Marissa Anderson told us, \"This naming is contingent upon well defined and universal criteria (eg: an organized area of low pressure with top winds of at least 39 mph). Names are given to these systems because they are discrete and naming provides a common link as these storms traverse international boundaries and multiple languages, and to distinguish between multiple storms that may threaten a region concurrently. Unlike tropical systems, winter storms are more diverse with impacts that evolve throughout the storm\u2019s life.\"",

Heavy snow and gusty winds are forecast from the southern Appalachians in Georgia through coastal regions of the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia.\n\nOn Friday, Jan. 30, the NWS said blizzard conditions were headed for the Carolinas due to a \"rapidly intensifying coastal cyclone.\" Affected regions, including the Carolinas and parts of Virginia and Georgia, can expect heavy snow, high winds and hazardous travel conditions.\n\n\"For cities such as Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro, this storm could be the biggest snowstorm in decades,\" AccuWeather said.\n\nThe weather service added that snow inland could reach 8 to 12 inches, along with snow drift from winds. Near the Outer Banks, the region could encounter gusts up to 70 mph, approaching hurricane-force winds, albeit with less snow, but with warnings for coastal flooding.\n\nHere are some photos of how residents and animals are faring:\n\nSee photos of the Carolinas amid snow storm\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci & Eduardo Cuevas/ USA TODAY",
